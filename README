ABOUT ISCABBS

Established in 1989, ISCABBS has provided a virtual community for students 
of the University of Iowa and the Internet in general. Today ISCABBS is the 
world's largest free bulletin board system on the Internet, with over 5,000 
active members. We have a validation structure to help prevent harassment 
while allowing for anonymity, a team of System Operators who help to maintain 
a near round the clock watch on activities, and nearly 200 discussion forums 
which cover a wide variety of topics, from the intensely technical to the 
sublimely silly.

The base code for ISCABBS is D.O.C. (Daves' Own Citadel), a telnet-based BBS 
code derived originally from Citadel. The D.O.C. code was written primarily 
by Dr.  David Lacey, then a student at the University of Iowa. In 2001 the 
code for D.O.C. was released under the GNU General Public License. Several 
variants have already been developed from this base code.

ISCABBS offers Intra-BBS electronic mail and real-time instant messages 
between users and a variety of forums covering many areas of academic and 
social discussion,  as well as general discussion forums.

ISCABBS was formerly owned and maintained by the Iowa Student Computer 
Association at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa. In 2007, ownership 
of the code and the BBS transferred to a nonprofit corporation composed of 
BBS users.
